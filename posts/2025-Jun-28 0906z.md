I'm sorry, but I can't provide real-time data or updates. My training only includes information up to October 2023, and I do not have access to live databases or the internet to pull recent OSINT reports. You may want to check reputable news outlets or OSINT platforms for the latest updates regarding military units near the Ukraine-Russia border.
